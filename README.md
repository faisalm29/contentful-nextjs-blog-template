# A Server Side Rendered Blog Template Using Next.js and Contentful

You can deploy your own by cloning this repository and add your own pages and features.

## Configuration

### Step 1. Create an account and space on Contentful

First, [create an account on Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/sign-up/).

After creating an account, create a new empty space from the dashboard and assign to it any name of your liking.

### Step 2. Create a content model

The [content model](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/concepts/data-model/) defines the data structures of your application/websites. The structures are flexible and you can tailor them to your needs.

For this example you need to create a content model that defines an **author** and a **post** content type.

#### Create an `Author` content type

From your contentful space, go to **Content model** and add a new content type:

- Give it the Name `Author`, the Api Identifier should be `author`.
  Once the content model is saved, add these fields (you don't have to modify the settings unless specified):
- `name` - **Text** field (type **short text**). **Field ID** should be set to `name`.
  picture - **Media** field (type **one file**). **Field ID** should be set to `picture`.

Save the content type and continue.

##### Create a `post` type

From your contentful space, go to **Content model** and add another content type:

- Give it the **Name** `Post`, the **Api Identifier** should be `post`

Next, add these fields (you don't have to modify the settings unless specified):

- `title` - **Text** field (type **short text**)
- `content` - **Rich text** field
- `excerpt` - **Text** field (type **Long text, full-text search**)
- `coverImage` - **Media** field (type **one file**)
- `date` - **Date and time** field
- `slug` - **Text** field. You can optionally go to the settings of this field, and under **Appearance**, select **Slug** to display it as a slug of the `title` field.
- `author` - **Reference** field (type **one reference**)

Save the content type and continue.

### Step 3. Populate Content

Go to the **Content** section in your space, then click on **Add entry** and select the **Author** content type:

- You just need **1 author entry**.
- Use dummy data for the text.
- For the image, you can download one from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) or [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).

Next, create another entry with the content type **Post**:

- We recommend creating at least **4 post entries**.
- Use dummy data for the text.
- For images, you can download them from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) or [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).
- Pick the **author** you created earlier.

**Important:** For each entry and asset, you need to click on **Publish**. If not, the entry will be in draft state.

**Important:** For each entry and asset, you need to click on **Publish**. If not, the entry will be in draft state.

### Step 4. Set up environment variables

From your contentful space, go to **Settings > API keys**. There will be an example Content delivery you can use these API keys. (You may also create a new key.)

Next, copy the `.env.local.example` file in this directory to `.env.local` (which will be ignored by Git):

Then set each variable on `.env.local`:

- `CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID` should be the **Space ID** field of your API Key
- `CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN` should be the **[Content Delivery API](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/) - access token** field of your API key

Your `.env.local` file should look like this:

```bash
CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=...
CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
```

### Step 5. Run Next.js in development mode

```bash
npm install
npm run dev

# or

yarn install
yarn dev
```

Your blog should be up and running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)!

### Step 6. Deploy on Vercel

To deploy your local project to Vercel, push it to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket and [import to Vercel](https://vercel.com/new).

**Important**: When you import your project on Vercel, make sure to click on **Environment Variables** and set them to match your `.env.local` file.
